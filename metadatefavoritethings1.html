	<figcaption> I absolutely love all dogs. I have a dog of my own named Baxter, and he is
	the cutest dog I&apos;ve ever seen. This, however, is not Baxter. This is Bailey, my aunts
	dog. My aunt lives on a farm, and this was my last day visiting when I snapped this
	photo of Bailey.</figcaption>

	<figcaption> Another thing I love is flowers. Whether it&apos;s taking photos of flowers or
	just looking at them, it&apos;s a great thing to take part in. </figcaption>

	<img src="IMG_6268.jpg" width="394" height="592" alt="My friends and I backstage at The Nutcracker">
	
	<figcaption> I absolutely love dance. It&apos;s been apart of my life since I was three years
	old. This is my friends and I backstage, posing for a picture during the intermission of
	our 2017 "Nutcracker". </figcaption>

	<img src="IMG_6707.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="Onstage at The Addams Family">
	
	<figcaption> Finally, and probably most importantly, I love theater. Theater encompasses
	so much of what I enjoy. Writing, reading, dancing, singing, photography, and art in general.
	It has been such a monumental part of my life, and has made me the person I am today.
	Without theater, I wouldn&apos;t have made half of the friends I currently have. </figcaption>
