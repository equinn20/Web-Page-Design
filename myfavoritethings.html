	<!-- FIGURE 1: dogs-->

<figure>
	<img src="Desktop/school/IMG_3961.jpg" width="496" height="296" alt=" I absoluetly love dogs">

	<figcaption> I absolutely love all dogs. I have a dog of my own named Baxter, and he is
	the cutest dog I've ever seen. This, however, is not Baxter. This is Bailey, my aunt's
	dog. My aunt lives on a farm, and this was my last day visiting when I snapped this
	photo of Bailey.</figcaption>

	<!-- FIGURE 2: flowers-->
	
<figure>	
	<img src="IMG_6418.jpg" width="432" height="324" alt="a flower at Longwood Gardens">

	<figcaption> Another thing I love is flowers. Whether it's taking photos of flowers or
	just looking at them, it's a great thing to take part in. </figcaption>

<!-- FIGURE 3: dance-->

<figure>
	<img src="IMG_6268.jpg" width="394" height="592" alt="My friends and I backstage at The Nutcracker"">
	
	<figcaption> I absolutely love dance. It's been apart of my life since I was three years
	old. This is my friends and I backstage, posing for a picture during the intermission of
	our 2017 "Nutcracker". </figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- FIGURE 4: musical theater-->

<figure>
	<img src="IMG_0926.jpg" width="650" height="635" alt="My friend and I backstage at The Music Man"">
	
	<figcaption> Finally, and probably most importantly, I love theater. Theater encompasses
	so much of what I enjoy. Writing, reading, dancing, singing, photography, and art in general.
	It has been such a monumental part of my life, and has made me the person I am today.
	Without theater, I wouldn't have made half of the friends I currently have. </figcaption>
