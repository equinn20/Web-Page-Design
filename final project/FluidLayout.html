        	and Arabic.In 1672 Elena's father sent her to the distinguished University of
        	Padua to continue her studies. Elena Piscopia's Examination for the Doctor of
        	Philosophy degree was to be held in the University Hall of the University of
        	Padua, but due to the multitude of spectators it was transferred to the
        	Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin, Padua. Throughout her examination,
        	Elena's brilliant answers amazed and awed her examiners. Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia
        	died at age thirty-eight on July 26, 1684. Her death is believed to have been
        	caused by tuberculosis. Her passing caused great mourning in Padua. </p>
