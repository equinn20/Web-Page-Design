			<!--history: explains the myth behind pygmy hippos-->
					
			<h3>History</h3>
			
				<p> The pygmy hippo has been fascinating humans since ancient Egypt. In fact,
				there have even been many folktales. The most popular folktale explain that pygmy
				hippos carry diamonds in their mouths, which lights their path. Before the
				hippo sleeps, it hides the diamond where it cannot be found. If one wants
				to catch a pygmy hippo, they must find the diamond. Then, they can have not
				only the hippo, but the diamond as well. However, they must catch the hippo at
				night.</p>

				<!--truth about pygmy hippos and their relation to their surroundings-->
			
			<h3>So, What is It?</h3>
				
				<p>The pygmy hippo are herbivores, similar to their relatives, the hippopotamus.
				Unlike the hippopotamus, however, pygmy hippos eat grass, fruits, and leaves from
				trees and other plants. These are all extremely accesible because of their location.
				Pygmy hippos live in the humid swaps and forests of West Africa. Because of
				their seclusion, the pygmy hippo is a solitary animal. The pygmy hippo is
				nocturnal, and pairing this with their seclusive nature, there are very few
				predators to the pygmy hippo. Leopards are their main predator, but pythons and
				crocodiles also also can attack and eat the hippos.</p>

			<!--conservation efforts for the pygmy hippo-->
			
			<h3>Conservation Efforts</h3>
			
				<p> While pygmy hippos may have very few natural predators, the human race
				is slowly destroying the species. Through hunting the species for their teeth
				and their meat and destroying their habitats, humans have severely damaged the
				pygmy hippos chances of survival. The species was last recorded to have 3,000
				left, but it is assumed that the number has since dropped. Several conservation
				efforts have been started, such as the Pygmy Hippo Foundation, which has
				since partnered with other organizations such as the Zoological Society of
				London (ZSL) and the EDGE of Existence organization to save the hippos. Many laws
				have been put in place to prevent hunting and deforestation, but very few are
				actively enforced.</p>
